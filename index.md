# Welcome to my Homepage
I am ath0rus (not my real name), "I love playing with code and making random and sometimes pointless things. Most of my projects will have something to do with cats hidden in it" - My github caption

I have finished all my exams at school and am getting ready to graduate. Recently I have been working on some coding projects, Mainly in python and some non coding projects like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). I am also learning all about [Arduino's](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction), and how to code them. If you want to have a look at any of my coding projects follow [this link](https://github.com/ath0rus) to my github account. If you want to see my Blender Renders I will post them In my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/q62V7SRfxE). Below are a few links to my other website and projects i am working on.
