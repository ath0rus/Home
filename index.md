I am ath0rus (not my real name), "I love playing with code and making random and sometimes pointless things. Most of my projects will have something to do with cats hidden in it" - My github caption

I am currently finishing off yr12 (highschool) in Australia, So besides studdying for my exams i have been working on some coding projects mainly in python and some non coding projects like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). if you want to have a look at any of my coding projects follow [this link](https://github.com/ath0rus) to my github account. if you want to see my Blender Renders i will post them sonwhere in my [Discord server](https://invite.gg/ath0rus).
